    "## What's this anti-vaccination thing about?\n",
    "There is a measles outbreak happening in the U.S. right now - 838 confirmed cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s an extremely contagious disease, that can remain in the air for up to two hours someone infected has left. And it’s become a public health nightmare.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disease starts with a rash at the head and then moves down the body. And it has significant long-term effects. It can cause brain damage, or a loss of hearing or eyesight, sometimes even death. About 1 in 4 measles patients will end up in a hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2000, the U.S. declared measles was eliminated. But in 2014, the number of measles cases started to skyrocket, in large part due to anti-vax misinformation spread on social media. \n",
    "\n",
    "But groups being opposed to vaccinations in the U.S. is nothing new. The first one, the Anti-Vaccination Society of America, was founded in 1879. And there are court battles against mandated vaccinations that can be traced back to 1902. The modern anti-vax movement actually starts in 1998, after a paper published by Andrew Wakefield, a British doctor who linked the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism. Though Wakefield had his medical license revoked and the paper has since been retracted, the damage was already been done. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few years, social media platforms like YouTube and Facebook allowed anti-vax groups to organize in a grassroots way."

    "\n",
    "Joasia and Chiara spoke with Renée DiResta on April 22, 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "Spoke about various objects of focus of anti-vaxxers over the years. “I think at some point research into the Marisol on the preservatives becomes a topic of focus. It's a type of type of mercury.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Revealed that lately, vaccine-focused churches have been popping up so that families can claim “religious” reasons for anti vaccination of their children.\n",
    "\n",
    "On YouTube as a platform for spreading misinformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "“How can we use YouTube to to get our content? I mean, most mainstream media properties won't run their stuff because they know that it's, you know, kind of a debunked conspiracy theory. And so, even though the media will occasionally do some kind of like false balance ISIS, for the most part, they won't, you know, put them on the mainstream news and give them a huge platform so YouTube was the way for them to get their popcorn.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“They do a good job of influencer marketing.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“It's just performative, especially in the days of social media, you can make any kind of ridiculous micro outrage micro aggressions go viral.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Russia has been “an interesting case for a long time” even though the narratives are different from the American ones. Interestingly, the Russian Orthodox communities in the US are very often vaccine hold outs. Lots of YouTube presence, celebrity amplified.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There's a computer science researcher who's anti vaccine named Stephanie sent us out of MIT, who did this really weird studies saying that it's glyphosate from Monsanto, that's a trace element in the vaccines. Again, just continuing with this like ingredients, ingredients, ingredients kind of thing.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Sent us an ethnography on background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Informed us about Washington events: “They were fundraising on GoFundMe, they raise $10,000 to run ads against the Washington bill claiming that it was going to be the start of government forced vaccination of your children.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Spoke to us about parental motivations: “Autism is just one thing. So there are some, some parents are motivated by this notion of like, purity.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Not always conservatives, libertarians are often anti-vcxx too: “That becomes a typical libertarian talking point is much more like a parental freedom, parental rights, particularly when the religion element does come into it again, even though no major world religion, or Canada, even the smaller ones that aren't like, you know, fake is opposed to vaccination.”"

    "On April 2, we accessed [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us) and found the School Immunization Survey data. These data contained the information collected from a survey of immunization records for each year since 2012-2013 from all schools in the state. \n",
    "\n",
    "They were broken down by percent immunized for diseases like polio and measles, and listed the percent of students who claimed religious or medical exemptions. It also contained information about the school district, like zip code, location and county. About 33,000 schools in total were in the data set. All counties except for those in NYC were removed from our data for analysis.\n",

    "Public schools measle vaccine rates were never below 93%, the amount estimated to maintain \"herd immunity.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Private school did not fair as well. Of the more than 2,500 surveys in this data, 259 didn't meet the \"herd immunity\" standard. Some of them, like [Redeemer Lutheran School](http://rlgschool.org) were below the immunity threshold every single year on record.\n",

    "[Rudolf Steiner School](https://steiner.edu) stood out in the data for a different reason. It's homepage touts that it's celebrating 90 years in buisness and claims to be \"[a] tradition that ignites modern minds.\" [It costs](https://www.privateschoolreview.com/rudolf-steiner-school-profile) just under $50,000 per year in tuition, but only 55 percent of its students were fully immunized. For measles, Rudolf Steiner was near the lowest threshold for herd immunity.\n",
